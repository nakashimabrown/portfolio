      </p>

      <p>
        trained as a 17th–19th century woodworker, nakashima-brown draws on historical precedents and centuries of craftsmanship to create furniture that balances timeless aesthetics with the functional needs of the 21st century. inspired by the japanese tea ceremony (chanoyu), he uses chanoyu and japanese/american folk art as frameworks to explore the intersection of art, craft, sculpture, and performance or installation.
      </p>

      <p>
        his current research examines the overlooked, bidirectional influence between chinese and american furniture traditions. his work has been exhibited nationally and internationally and featured in monocle, architectural digest, and fine woodworking.
