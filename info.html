  <p>
    Hugo Nakashima-Brown is an award-winning designer, woodworker, and teaching artist based in Boston, MA. He holds a BFA in Painting from Rhode Island School of Design and a degree in Cabinet & Furniture Making from the North Bennet Street School. His multidisciplinary experience spans woodworking, design, curation, and production studio management, allowing him to blend diverse perspectives into his craft.
  </p>
  <p>
    Trained in 17th- to 19th-century woodworking traditions, Nakashima-Brown draws on historical precedents and centuries of craftsmanship to create furniture that balances timeless aesthetics with the functional demands of the 21st century. Inspired by the Japanese tea ceremony (chanoyu), where design, function, and aesthetics converge, he uses chanoyu and Japanese/American folk art as frameworks to explore intersections between art, craft, sculpture, and installation. His current research examines bidirectional influences between Chinese and American furniture traditions.
  </p>
  <p>
    Nakashima-Brown’s work has been exhibited nationally and internationally and has been featured in <em>Monocle</em>, <em>Architectural Digest</em>, and <em>Fine Woodworking</em>. He has received support from institutions including the Penland School of Craft, Winterthur Museum, Mt. Fuji Wood Culture Society, Center for Furniture Craftsmanship, Oak Spring Garden Foundation, and the International Furnishings and Design Association. He also serves on the selection committee for the Alex Brown Foundation.
