<p><strong>Catskill Terrace, 2024</strong></p>

<p>The first project I was entrusted with completing at Rowan Woodwork was the face frames for a kitchen project designed to match the home’s exterior cedar siding. Visible from the kitchen, the frames needed to read as continuous siding, with consistent vertical kerfs running from floor to ceiling. To achieve this, custom panels were veneered with resawn 3/16” oak, and the width of each individual board was varied to account for differences in reveal across push-to-open doors, fridge panels, uppers, and false fronts. Accounting for compound error over the length of a panel, I calculated that if any cut was off by more than 0.3 mm (under 1/64”), the kerf would drift outside the glue line by the end of a run.</p>

<p>After sawing, thicknessing, and ripping the veneers, they were laminated to MDF panels in a vacuum press. To maintain registration from the ripped lines and keep everything perfectly square—especially critical with uninterrupted vertical lines over a 14-foot span—I fabricated an L-shaped fence to flush-cut from the vertical edge of the veneered panels. Faces were then cut to size, the false siding kerf added using a 1/8” flat-top blade, and assemblies dry-fit and checked in the shop prior to installation.</p>

 <p>I resawed, thickness, veneered, and cut all face frames and mounted them to plywood boxes for this project. The boxes were CNC-cut by another employee, finishing was handled by our in-house finisher, and installation was completed by a separate crew.</p>

<p>My role on this residential project was to cut and assemble the kitchen island and bath, as well as cut and band all face frames for the kitchen and its passage return, pictured left. The primary challenge was material selection. Rift white oak was in short supply at the time, and even after refusing two shipments due to excessive sequence breaks, the sequenced rift stock we ultimately used contained three separate sequences.</p>

<p>Because of this, there was effectively no room for waste. On the passage run, the sequence began at the far left and terminated midway through the far-right panel. Two panels with similar grain direction—though not from the same sequence—were reserved for the returns. The remainder of that sequence was used for the kitchen island and bath face frames and returns, while a separate sequence was allocated to the main kitchen cabinet faces.</p>

  <p>Given the cost of the material and the zero tolerance for error, this project was a valuable exercise in organizing, tracking, and executing high-value stock under tight deadlines, with acceptable error measured at under ~1/64”.</p>

  <p> An exceptionally complex project I assisted with at Rowan Woodwork was this curtain wall for a Long Island home and lighting showroom. To make installation feasible for a built-in element of this scale, we developed slot-shaped stub tenons housed in corresponding mortises at the top and bottom rails. The upper mortises were cut slightly deeper than required, allowing the vertical slats to be lifted into place and then dropped down to seat fully in the bottom mortises.

  <p>I prepped the lumber and cut the mortises and tenons for this project alongside the shop foreman. Installation was managed by the foreman with a separate crew.</p>
